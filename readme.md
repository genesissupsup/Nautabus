# Nautabus

## Overview

Nautabus is not a bus. It is a light-weight, hostable server that provides durable messaging 
services between multiple client applicaitons. Nautabus implements a Publish-Subscribe 
architectural design pattern over RESTful APIs and WebSockets.

Nautabus can be self-hosted as a console application, windows service, IIS Site, or 
Azure WebApp. For enhanced reliability or heavy workloads, multiple instances of Nautabus 
can be scaled out to webfarm and cloud environments as well.
